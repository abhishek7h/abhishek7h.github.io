        <span className="text-7xl font-serif">I</span> am Abhishek Hari. I am a
        student, but I really am much more than that. I like to code stuff -
        websites, to be precise. I am a web developer with experience in HTML,
        vanilla CSS and Javascript, but also React and Tailwind. Other than
        building things in the interwebs, I write pretty good{" "}

        code. I use Python to make games. I dived into the world of coding when
        I was rather young, exploring Python with Spyder, I wrote my first line
        of code. My passion for programming increased, when I became good at
        Python and started navigating Javascript. I took a game-dev course with
        WhiteHat Jr, and I learnt a bit more about JS game development. I used
        to make websites with HTML, JS and CSS, but when I learnt about React, I
        understood the true potential of web development.

        Other than being a developer, I am a passionate poet and writer. My
        passion for poetry came not from a poet, but from a football commentator
        who spoke poetry, Peter Drury. His words amused me, and drove me into
        writing poems. I also write articles about self-help, including
        mental-health and life, which can be found on my{" "}

        about tech, including Artifical Intelligence and smartphones. I was a
        writer at a tech publication called{" "}

        <br />I also like doing photography. I do a lot of nature photography,
        including birds and flowers. I use a Nikon D3400, with the kit lens
        (18-55mm).
        <br />
        <br />I love tech, and I am an active tweeter on X's tech community (fka
        Twitter). I talk about smartphones, operating systems, and share my
        opinions on various aspects of tech. I use Android and Arch, BTW. I
        daily-drive a Galaxy A34 (OneUI 6.0), and use an iPhone SE 2020 (iOS
        17.4.1) as my secondary. I use a Lenovo Ideapad Slim 5 (Ryzen 5) running
        Arch Linux.

        <br />I love playing and watching the Beautiful Game, football. My
        favorite club for eternity is FC Barcelona.{" "}

        fell in love with the game is the GOAT himself, Lionel Messi. I play CB

        Scholes.
